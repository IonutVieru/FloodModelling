<h1>Identification of urban areas under flood risk
by considering the effect of soil infiltration in
future scenarios using FLO-2D flood model</h1>
</div>
<div style="width:50%; margin: 0 auto;font-size: 20px;">
  <p>Urban areas are under constant risk of flooding due to changing climatic conditions, urbanization,
and variability in rainfall patterns. Rapid changes in the hydrological cycle are putting more
pressure on the urban infrastructure and reducing their resilience to changing climatic effects, and
it is pertinent to say here that urban areas must be prepared for more frequent extreme rainfall
events in the future. Land-use changes increased unplanned urbanization, poor management of
water bodies and insufficient drainage of water increases the chances of urban areas to get flooded
with even light rain.</p>
<p>This report describes a case study analysis of a coastal urban area KÃ¸ge to
develop and test an urban flood simulation model in FLO-2D, and to identify the inundated urban
areas under extreme events. To simulate the water flow depth, and flow velocity was measured
under different extreme events return periods (cloudburst event 2nd of July 2011, 50-years return
period, and 100-years return period) and the impact of soil infiltration rate was considered
throughout the process.<p>
<p>Under all projected scenarios results show slight variation in floodplain
storage, soil infiltration capacity, and hydrograph outflow. The study was conducted under 7
different extreme events with up to 100 years projection data from DMI and it was concluded that
flood-prone hotspots under low, medium and high flood risks remain consistent when observed
through the flood hazard map.<p>
<p>The flood simulation model was validated after comparing our
results with SCALGO, flooded urban areas remain the same in both models with differences
regarding the flow depth. It was also concluded that by considering the sewage capacity in urban
areas, increased soil infiltration through more natural surfaces, and some proposed sustainable
urban drainage systems, the risk of flooding under an extreme event can be reduced significantly.</p>
